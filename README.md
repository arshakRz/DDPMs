PosModel: Robust Behavioral Latent Embedding Toolkit Based on
Spatioâ€‘Temporal Graph Modeling

### Under Construction...
* **Warning: This project is still under development and it's not yet ready for real-world usage!** Please wait for the first official release... :)
* more detail will be added after the first official release

This repository contains the implementation of the PoseModel project. This project aims to uncover complex behavioral patterns in a novel way by utilizing robust Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for latent embedding. Through spatiotemporal graph modeling, the proposed method captures intricate relationships in behavioral data, enabling more accurate and insightful analysis.

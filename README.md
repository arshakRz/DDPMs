Applications of DDPMs in Medical Imaging: This code contains implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models with Classifer Free Guidance and DDIM sampler. One can use this implementation on any sort of data such as fMRI.

### Under Construction...
* **Warning: This project is still under development and it's not yet ready for real-world usage!** Please wait for the first official release... :)
* Soon the code would be available in the form of a library which could be installed using ```pip install``` command.
* more detail will be added after the first official release

Here are some results of the code on the MNIST dataset:
